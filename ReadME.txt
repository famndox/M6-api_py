Started with the Starter Code
File path:
Starter_Code:
   - ReadME <<< You Are Here
   - output_data:
      - original_output:
	     - I moved my original output files here (with 545 results - as seen in WeatherPy solution results prior to rerunning)
         - cities.csv (ran with 545 results)
	     - Fig1...City Latitude vs. Max Temp
	     - Fig2...City Latitude vs. Humidity
	     - Fig3...City Latitude vs. Cloudiness
	     - Fig4...City Latitude vs. Wind Speed
      - left this folder clear for you to re-run with new random city generation, will output:
         - cities.csv (ran with 'x' results)
	     - Fig1...City Latitude vs. Max Temp
	     - Fig2...City Latitude vs. Humidity
	     - Fig3...City Latitude vs. Cloudiness
	     - Fig4...City Latitude vs. Wind Speed
   - starter_code:
      - api_keys...you don't get to see this
	  - WeatherPy...runs the WeatherPy program <<< Run this
	  - VacationPy...runs the VacationPy program <<< Run this
	  # Note that if re-running weatherPy with new results, use second 'commented' line of code in Load CSV cell
	  
	  
Not much else to say, had to use the documentation for this one:
